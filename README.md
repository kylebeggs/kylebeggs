Hi, I’m Kyle Beggs ([@kylebeggs](https://github.com/kylebeggs)), a scientific software engineer at [Metalenz](https://metalenz.com/). My work spans across most aspects of scientific software and simulation, from construction of differential operators for PDE solvers to reduced-order modeling, geometry/CAD operations and meshing, all the way to DevOps. Right now, my work is split in two arenas - electromagnetics/optics and biomechanics.
