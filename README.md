Hi, Iâ€™m Kyle Beggs ([@kylebeggs](https://github.com/kylebeggs)), a software engineer at [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/) building computational cardiovascular models. I'm interested in multiscale and multiphysics models in medicine (say that five times fast ðŸ¤£) to facilitate fundamental research and as planning tools for medical procedures. Please reach out if any of my packages or work interest you, I'm keen on working with others.

Check out my website at [kylebeggs.com](https://kylebeggs.com)!
