Hi, I’m Kyle Beggs, a software engineer at [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/company/about-us) building computational cardiovascular models 🖥️🫀. I'm interested in multiscale and multiphysics models in medicine (say that five times fast 🤣) to facilitate fundamental research and as planning tools for medical procedures. Please reach out if any of my packages or work interest you, I'm keen on working with others.
